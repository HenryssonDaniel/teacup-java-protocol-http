## What ##
HTTP version 1.1 and 2 support.  

The framework supports asynchronously and synchronously requests.  

There is currently no support for any HTTP server.

## Why ##
This makes it possible to test HTTP with the framework.

## How ##
Add this repository as a dependency.  

The Client interface holds all the functionality that the HTTP client can do.  
New clients can be created with the ClientFactory class.
